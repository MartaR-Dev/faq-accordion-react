## Overview

### The Challenge

This exercise has the following challenges, where the users should be able to:

- [x] Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- [x] Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- [ ] View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- [x] See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My Process

### Built With

- CSS
- Bootstrap
- React

### What I Learned

- Usage of React's state to animate the hiding and showing of the answers.
- Introduction/First attempt at making the FAQ accessible through keyboard

### Continued Development / Known Issues

Based on this first project, I noticed that I want and need to keep working and practicing React, CSS and many more things, in order to gain experience, knowledge and confidence in my skills.

Here are some things I want to keep working on in the future:

- Semantic HTML
- Accessability
- Keyboard Accessibility
- React functions (interaction, etc)
- Better CSS and styling (layout, css rules, etc)

Here are some currently known issues that I was not yet able to tackle in ths project:

- [ ] Optimal view for mobile
- [ ] Fix background cutting off when more FAQ show (at the bottom of th page it cuts from the pink to white)
- [ ] Making the animation of the answer showing push down the item and keeping the question in the same position - currently it seems to push both up and down, moving the question up.
